# REPOConfig-overlap-patch
REPO beta build has menu and settings overlap. The mod owner won't release for beta, so I fixed it. <br />

## Installation
Just overwrite the file in `<your-mod-package-here>\BepInEx\plugins\nickklmao-REPOConfig`.<br />
You can navigate to the right folder by opening R2modman, selecting a profile, and going into settings. There will be an option to "Browse profile folder".
